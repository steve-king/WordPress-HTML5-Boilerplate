#WordPress HTML5 Boilerplate

Barebones WordPress theme based on HTML5 boilerplate: http://html5boilerplate.com/

Includes automatic stylesheet/script versioning functions (for cache busting), LESS CSS folder (be sure to compile "style.less" to "style.css" located in the root directory)

.htaccess, 404.html, crossdomain.xml, humans.txt, robots.txt and favicon/apple touch icons all reside in the "boilerplate" directory. Move these to the root folder on your server if you want to use them (but be sure not to overwrite the WordPress .htaccess rules).

The theme does not assume any kind of site structure. Only index.php is incuded along with a basic loop.
